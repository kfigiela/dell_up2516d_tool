# Dell UP2516D/UP2716D monitor tool

New Dell monitors expose USB to I2C interface on built-in hub. Dell provides SDK to take advantage of it (http://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03325158M/1/DellMonitorSDK_1_01r2_FINAL.zip) and makes it possible to control every setting of the monitor from code. This is nice!

I'm using this code to control brightness (and more settings if necessary in my use case) using keyboard shourtcuts :)
